# Humidity_Converter

## Introduction

*Humidity_converter* exists for anyone who is obsessed with monitoring the  
humidity in their home, and who wonders how opening the windows and letting
outside air in will change the situation. Inside air and outside air often
have different sources of moisture, and different temperatures (temperature
  affects the relative humidity experienced with a given amount of moisture
  in the air), which means that bringing outside air inside, where it takes
  on inside-temperatures can alter the humidity experienced inside.
